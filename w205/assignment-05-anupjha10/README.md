# Assignment 05

In this assignment, you'll spin up a cluster with redis and a mids base
container.  You'll use a python redis client library to connect to the redis
server.


## The Basics

Follow the steps we did in class to get redis and the mids base container talking.

### What you turn in:
- In your `/assignment-05-<user-name>` repo:
	* your `docker-compose.yml` 
	* once you've run the example on your terminal
	  * Run `history > <user-name>-history.txt` (ok for this to be messy)
	  * Save the relevant portion of your history as `<user-name>-annotations.md`
	  * Annotate the file with explanations of what you were doing at each point (See `htmartin-annotations.md`)

## Bonus

Look up and use some basic redis functions from python:

- `put` some key/values
- `get` some key/values

## More Bonus!
