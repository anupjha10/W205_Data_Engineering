# My annotations, Assignment 5


## Here I'm opening the directory that has my docker-compose file in it.
  501  cd w205/redis-cluster/

## Next, I'm checking what's in my directory.
  502  ls

## I'm spinning up my redis cluster.
  507  docker-compose up -d

## etc until you take down the cluster...
